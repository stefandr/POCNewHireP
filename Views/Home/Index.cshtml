    <p>This is the Microsoft Entra Verified ID Onboarding with TAP sample.</p>
    <div>
        <p>
            In order to succesfully use this sample, you have to do the following:
            <ul style="text-align:left; margin-left:50px">
                <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/verified-id/verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant-quick" target="_blank">Set up Verified ID</a></li>
                <li>
                    Create an AppRole named 'UserAdmin' for the app registration and add the admin user to that role (Enterprise Apps > Users and groups). The role is needed to either register new hires or update the list of trusted B2B partners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Employee Onboarding:
                    <ul>

                        </li>

                        </li>

                        <li>As the new hire, use the onboarding link, do the identity verification step and get access to your account via the TAP code.</li>
                    </ul>
